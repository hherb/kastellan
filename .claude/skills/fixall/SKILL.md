Address all issues identified in the code review one by one. If fixing them appears manageable within this session, fix them now. If not, lodge the issue on github. Once all issues have been addressed, review the code changes thoroughly. If satisfied no issues left open, update HANDOVER.md and ROADMAP.md ONY if necessary to reflect these changes. Then commit and push the changes into the PR.
