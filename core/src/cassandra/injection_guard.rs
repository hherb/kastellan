//! Worker-output prompt-injection guard.
//!
//! Pure-function catalogue scan called from `tool_host::dispatch`
//! after `worker.call` returns Ok, before the result is appended to
//! the scheduler's conversation history. The chokepoint pattern
//! (Option M, issue #16) means every worker result passes through
//! exactly one screen, with no bypass path.
//!
//! On `InjectionDecision::Block` the caller replaces the worker
//! result with a redacted placeholder and writes a second audit row
//! carrying only the SHA-256 of the scanned body + length + score +
//! class codes — never the raw scanned text. See
//! [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-worker-output-prompt-injection-guard-design.md`](../../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-worker-output-prompt-injection-guard-design.md)
//! for the full design.
//!
//! ## Why a separate module
//!
//! The screen is a pure function over `&str` so the catalogue stays
//! greppable (one weight + pattern + class per entry) and the helper
//! is exercisable without the async dispatcher machinery.
//!
//! ## Scope (Slice 1, deliberately narrow)
//!
//! - Substring matching after `normalize` (lowercase + strip
//!   zero-width). No regex, no leetspeak fold, no multilingual
//!   coverage. The catalogue is meant to be read in one sitting.
//! - Two-tier verdict (`Allow` / `Block`). A future Review tier slots
//!   in via the `#[non_exhaustive]` enum.
//! - Per-rule weights summed (cap 1.0); threshold `BLOCK_THRESHOLD`.
